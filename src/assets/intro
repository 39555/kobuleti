There was a time when the Gods of Olympus squabbled to gain favor from the mortals of the earth. Chaos and war consumed the land as monsters, beasts, and humans fought and died in the name of their chosen God. With each village that burned and temple that was destroyed, one God’s favor rose while another God’s favor fell. This never ending cycle of death and destruction continued to torment the land and its creatures until even Gaia, our mother Earth, forsook all that she had once loved and fell into slumber. Yet, not all the humans favored the Gods. Some wished for the death of the Gods. Only a few decided to go and slay the Gods. This is the story of the Godslayers.
