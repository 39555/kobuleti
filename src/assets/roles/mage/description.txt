Player blew dust from the cover of the old book and opened its pages. The first page had a picture of a person shooting fire from their hands and burning two black beasts. On the second page there was an incantation that was placed amidst a scribble of texts and diagrams. As Player recited the incantation, his/her hands suddenly erupted into flames yet it did not burn. All of playerâ€™s fears vanished as he/she began to realize the amount of power that he/she had at her fingertips (literally). Yet, great power is nothing without practice. As the armory door burst open with a wave of monsters, Player walked calmly forward with flames trailing from his/her hands. It was time to practice.
Firestorm: Can attack twice. First attack can target any monster. The second attack can only target monsters in the blocked lanes.
