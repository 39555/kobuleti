The bloodied long sword shimmered eerily as player approached it. Perhaps it was a trick of light but player thought he saw the blood stains move across the dorsal side of the blade. As player grasped the hilt of the strange sword, he/she felt a hunger that seemed to emit from the sword. A hunger to cut through the muscle and bone of monsters and men. The same hunger that player had felt for all his/her life. As the armory door burst open with the first wave of monsters, Player charged towards them and roared, not with fear but with rage.
